OUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT
So, we were told to connect our system to a network that has other devices connected to that network and then scan all the devices on that network.

To get started, we have to connect to the network and then know our device IP address

After knowing my device IP address, i then proceeded to know the gateway of the network i'm connected to.

Next up, we captured packets from a network connection i.e we were able to listen to different packets that were communicating while network communication was ongoing.

To get started, we started our wireshark application(a network protocol analyzer)
