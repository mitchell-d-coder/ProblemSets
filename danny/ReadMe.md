OUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT
So, we were told to connect our system to a network that has other devices connected to that network and then scan all the devices on that network.

To get started, we have to connect to the network and then know our device IP address

After knowing my device IP address, i then proceeded to know the gateway of the network i'm connected to.

Finally, i scanned all the devices on the network to know the available open ports that could be exploited.

OUR SECOND ASSIGNMENT
Next up, we captured packets from a network connection i.e we were able to listen to different packets that were communicating while network communication was ongoing.

To get started, we started our wireshark application(a network protocol analyzer)

OUR THIRD ASSIGNMENT
DEAUTHENTICATION USING THE AIRCRACK SUITE IN KALI LINUX

TO start with, we typed iwconfig in the terminal and look for your wireless card (and change the default mode to monitor.

Now run iwconfig again to verify that our interfaceâ€™s name has changed and that it is indeed in Monitor mode.

Then,we visualize all Access Points and clients around us and choosing a target
Once we have located our target AP we will take note of the MAC address (bssid) and the channel it is broadcasting on.

Once we have selected a client we wish to disassociate, we will run our deauth attack using aireplay-ng
